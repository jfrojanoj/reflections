What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a new repo, it is created a new hidden directory called .git/ and this directory is initialized with necesary metadata for the correct functioning of the repository. We need to do this because if not you cannot call that directory a repo and wouldn't have all functionality of a repo!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is intended to hold the files that are ready to be commited, any change made in a file in the working directory that has been previously added to the staging area will not change the stagged file. When we want to commit, all the staging area will be commited in a single commit. The value that offers is that if i have a file in which i make all the intended changes, i can stag that file and wait for other files to be changed and then make a unique commit. In the case that i need to change anything in the stagged file, i can remove the file from the staging area, and then stage the modified file without uncommiting anything.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The difference between the staging area and the working directory allow to know what modifications have been made to the files in certain period. If I keep track of this changes, I'll know when to make a significant commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When you want to make changes to a project, but you also want to keep the original project i.e. changing lenguaje, some feature, etc. Branches help in keeping the different projects organized and separated one of another.
