How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you to see the bug that was introduced?

When the files don't have many differences it is easy to see the bugs, but if the file has many changes, it would be difficult to search for bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you more efficient programmer in the long term?

This easy access allows to the programmer to see past version of his code which in turn allows the programmer to learn from his owns mistakes and others mistakes. Also this allows to look for bad programming techniques and change this problems.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros: you commit whenever you want, which gives flexibility to the commits. You have control over the amount of changes to be commited.
cons: If you forget to commit, then yo can lose your work (if you are unlucky)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Git is intended to be a version control system for programming, and in programming is usual and necessary to have projects with multiple files that are interconected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives the history of commits made to the repository, git log --stat gives more info than git log, git diff allows to compare two different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

this confidence is due to the fact that if I made a change that break something, I can return to a previous version of my project and strat from there.

Now that you have your worh space set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to try to develop python projects at my work.
